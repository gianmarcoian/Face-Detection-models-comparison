# Face Detection Models Comparison
Welcome to the Face Detection Models Comparison repository!
In this repository, you can find:
- `report.docx`: This document illustrates the results of the study conducted.
- `notebook.ipynb`: The Python notebook containing the code.
- cvlibtest.py
- dnntest.py
- mtcnntest.py
- haarcascadetest.py

The last 4 python scripts (ending with test) are  for face detection in real-time-> video 
I hope to update this repository in the future as I plan to work more frequently on this matter. This was my very first approach to this field, and I look forward to enhancing and expanding upon it.
## How to Use
To replicate the results or experiment with the code, you can follow these steps:
1. Clone this repository 
2. Navigate into the cloned directory
3. Open the `notebook.ipynb` file.
4. Run the cells in the notebook to execute the code and explore the results.
## License
Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or suggestions! I wiil be very glad if someone wants to teach me more about this field.
